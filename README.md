Welcome to the sktime tutorial at Europython 2023
=================================================

This tutorial is about [sktime] - a unified framework for machine learning with time series. sktime contains algorithms and tools for building, applying, evaluating modular pipelines and composites for a variety of time series learning tasks, including forecasting, classification, regression.

`sktime` is easily extensible by anyone, and interoperable with the python data science stack.

This is an introductory `sktime` half-day tutorial with:

* a general introduction to `sktime`
* forecasting with `sktime` - uni/multivariate, hierarchical/global, probabilistic
* feature extraction, transformation pipelines, parameter tuning, autoML
* time series classification, regression, and clustering with `sktime`
* customizing time series distances, kernels, time series aligners and alignment distances
* engineering topics:
    * APIs, estimator and dependency management
    * writing `sktime` compatible 3rd party estimators
* deploying `sktime` in production using `mlflow` with the `mlflavours` plugin

## :rocket: How to get started

In the tutorial, we will move through notebooks section by section.

You have different options how to run the tutorial notebooks:

* Run the notebooks in the cloud on [Binder] - for this you don't have to install anything!
* Run the notebooks on your machine. [Clone] this repository, get [conda], install the required packages (`sktime`, `seaborn`, `jupyter`) in an environment, and open the notebooks with that environment. For detail instructions, see below. For troubleshooting, see sktime's more detailed [installation instructions].
* or, use python venv, and/or an editable install of this repo as a package. Instructions below.

## :bulb: Description

This tutorial presents [sktime] - a unified framework for machine learning with time series. sktime covers multiple time series learning problems, including time series transformation, classification and forecasting, among others.`sktime` allows you to easily apply an algorithm for one task to solve another (e.g. a scikit-learn regressor to solve a forecasting problem). In the tutorial, you will learn about how you can identify these problems, what their key differences are and how they are related.

`sktime` provides various time series algorithms and modular composition tools for pipelining, ensembling and tuning.
`sktime` also provides API compatible interfaces to many popular libraries, such as `statsmodels`, `prophet`, `statsforecast`, `tslearn`, `tsfresh`, etc,
which can be readily combined using `sktime` composition patterns.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use, combine, tune and evaluate different algorithms on real-world data sets.
The tutorial consists of step-by-step using Jupyter Notebooks.

`sktime` not just a package, but also an active community which aims to be welcoming to new joiners.
We invite anyone to get involved as a developer, user, supporter (or any combination of these).
